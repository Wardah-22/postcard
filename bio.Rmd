## Bio

<!--Akim van Eersel studied experimental physics and its associated means of
measurement. After working in industrial instrumentation and research optronics,
he decided to reorient himself in data science. Since the beginning of 2020,
he has been learning independently the associated programming languages,
the workflow from harvesting to data analysis, statistics, linear models and
machine learning.-->

Akim van Eersel is a materials science engineer with 2 years of experience in
R&D. He is used to working with data measurements, from harvesting
to data analysis, statistics, and modeling. Since 2020 he has focused
and specialized to gain a better data science workflow proficiency.
